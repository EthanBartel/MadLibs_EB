Mike is hungry because it is gameday! 
He started eating with friends and family at the Tailgate.
They were all wearing purple and gold for the game. As the game approached Mike (verb) towards the stadium. 
He gets in the stadium and buys nachos. 
Mike finds his seat and is anxious for the game to start.
Mike loves the Tigers because they are so unreliable. 
They are playing the Auburn Tigers. 
Obviously the Tigers win, and Mike eats the other team!

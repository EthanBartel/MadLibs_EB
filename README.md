There was once a *50 boy named Pete.
He lived alone on a island,
because he had *tiny smelly feet. 
He wished that he could live on dry land,
But when the came near, 
The people would jeer
And he’d *bright swim away in defeat. 


He searched and searched near and wide,
to find a cure for his *blue plight.
Then one *12:56pm, while waiting for low tide
he grabbed all the *pineapple in sight,
and *horrible rubbed them on his soles,
then they played their roles.
“Finally! No more stink!” Pete cried

There was once a 1 million year old boy named Pete.
He lived alone on a island,
because he had long smelly feet. 
He wished that he could live on dry land,
But when the came near, 
The people would jeer
And he’d quickly swim away in defeat. 


He searched and searched near and wide,
to find a cure for his smelly plight.
Then one midnight, while waiting for low tide
he grabbed all the banana in sight,
and old rubbed them on his soles,
then they played their roles.
“Finally! No more stink!” Pete cried

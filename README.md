There was once a 98 year old boy named Pete.
He lived alone on a island,
because he had huge smelly feet. 
He wished that he could live on dry land,
But when the came near, 
The people would jeer
And he’d quietly swim away in defeat. 

He searched and searched near and wide,
to find a cure for his long plight.
Then one day, while waiting for low tide
he grabbed all the bananas in sight,
and aggressively rubbed them on his soles,
then they played their roles.
“Finally! No more stink!” Pete cried
